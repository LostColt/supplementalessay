            <div class="prose">
                <p>When it comes to the "Why This School" essay, most students are under the impression that they're supposed to compliment the school, like you're writing a love letter.</p>
                <p><em>"Your campus is beautiful, your programs are strong, you have an excellent reputation."</em></p>
                <p>But here's what you need to understand-they already know all that. They don't need you to tell them they're great.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="blockquote">
                <p>What they actually want to know is: <strong>Do you know what we have here? Like, really know? And can you do anything with it?</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="prose">
                <p>Think about it this way. If you walked into your first day of DECA and said "I want to do business because business is important and companies make money," everyone would wonder why you're actually there. But if you said "I've been running a small resale operation for six months, mostly through Instagram, and I keep hitting the same problem with inventory forecasting-I want to work on the business plan competition because I need to figure out how to scale without tying up all my cash in stock"-now you sound like someone who's already doing it and has a real reason to join.</p>
                <p>That's what this essay is. It's not "your school is great." It's <strong>"I've been doing this thing, and you have this specific resource that would let me take it further, and here's exactly what I'd do with it."</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card card-navy">
                <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; text-align: center;"><strong>Can you identify the resource?</strong></p>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>It is okay if you aren't 100% sure, but you cannot sound confused in your essay. You have two options:</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="display: grid; gap: 1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; color: var(--gulliver-navy); margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">1. The Intersection Play</h3>
                    <p class="prose mb-0">Many schools let you combine majors or build interdisciplinary programs. If your interests connect (e.g., Computer Science + Philosophy), write about the intersection. Show how you need both majors to solve the problems you care about (e.g., "I need CS to build AI, but Philosophy to understand its ethics").</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="card card-highlight">
                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; color: var(--gulliver-navy); margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">2. The Evidence Play</h3>
                    <p class="prose mb-0">If you are torn between two totally different fields (e.g., Engineering vs. English) that don't overlap, look at your resume. Which one has more "evidence" (activities, classes, projects)? Write about that one.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <p class="prose mb-0"><strong>Remember:</strong> You can usually change your major later, but for the essay, you need a clear narrative.</p>
